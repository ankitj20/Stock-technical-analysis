# Stock-technical-analysis
In this project, I created a program which will generate graph of stock based on the user inputs and do a technical analysis on it. 

This program will ask user for a stock name as input, then it will collect data from yahoo finance using pandas datareader, then it will create a interactive dashboard using dash library from python to show graph.

Then using fucntions from TA-lib library, this program will compute indicator values for stock and plot the result using matplotlib. Then it will plot a candlestick graph and engulfing pattern using mplfinance library.
